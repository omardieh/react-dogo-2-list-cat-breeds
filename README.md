# -react-dogo-2-list-cat-preeds
Make a small application to list all cat breeds using the Cat facts API

The API allows you to retrieve cat breeds at the following url: https://catfact.ninja/breeds . 
It will only return the first 25 entries. 
You will therefore have to create a paging system to display the different data.

- Step 1: Simply retrieve the first page
- Step 2: Display the next and previous buttons to navigate as well as a button for each available page (4 with this API).
- Step 3: Add style to mark the current page
